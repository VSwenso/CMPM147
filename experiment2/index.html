				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this project the goal was to create a living impression via Procedural Generation.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used glitch.com to work on this assignment. To create my own landscape and shapes I used 
					examples from class, slides, chatgpt, and some youtube videos to help me create and implement 
					my work. Specifically with the gradient sky background I used a mix of Youtube examples and chatgpt. 
					but with the trees and bushes I applied what was shown in class. To make the landscape follow the movement
					from the mouse I used one of the examples provided through the tutorial slides. 
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>While the assignment as a whole wasn't too crazy or confusing, most of my work was me researching
					and testing out different methods to see what worked for me. Since this was my first time playing around
					with creating landscapes through code and then using procedural generation on top of that, starting of was 
					a little rusty because I was trying to teach myself. But throughout the process of working on this assignment
					I definitley have learned a lot about how to create shapes and get them moving. I am pretty satisfied with 
					how the end product looks right now, however, I honestly want to spend a bit more time on this outside of class
					to really push myself to see what I can create.
