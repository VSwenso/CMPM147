// Here is how you might set up an OOP p5.js project
// Note that p5.js looks for a file called sketch.js

// Constants - User-servicable parts
// In a longer project I like to put these in a separate file

let p51 = new p5(s1, "canvas-container1");


let p52 = new p5(s2, "canvas-container2");


let p53 = new p5(s3, "canvas-container3");
