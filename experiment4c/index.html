				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is the third and last of the three generators I created with my partner for this assignment, Tory. This is world where a sunset gradient is applied throughout the world with rocks at various spaces moving up and down in a wave-like fashion.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To create this generator, I used sine functions and millis. I had to create the shape and movement of the ripple by defining its amplitude, frequency and speed based on the values of said sine functions and millis.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, this generator was the coolest to make. Adding the images of the rocks and applying the wave effect really gave it life. This generator was definitely the hardest to create however, but definitely the most satisfying to see work. This generator satisfies all of the project requirements.
