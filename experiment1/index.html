				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> For this project I was aiming on creating and implementing my working generator</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It randomly picks through the filler words I gave it and generates terrible pick-up lines with the information I gave it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The Project itself wasn't that hard mainly since it is just an introduction to what generators can do. I did have a lot of fun coming up with descriptions and adjectives for my project. But I was a little bit confused with how to transfer my code from Glitch into my VsCode.</p>
