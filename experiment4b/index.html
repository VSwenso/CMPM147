				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This was the second of three generators I created with my partner for this assignment, Ani. At first, it may seem like a black and gray empty world, but all of that changes when the user clicks on a tile. Using the clicked tile as an origin point, a hyponotic sinusoidal effect ensues. The effect is dependent on the seed of the world. Some seeds have very similar outputs and differences may seem negligible.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To create this generator, gray tiles are randomly placed among an empty black world. This is so that the user has a rough reference as to where they are in the world. When the user clicks on a tile, displacement based on distance from the clicked tile and time that has passed occurs on all tiles on the screen to create a hypnotic effect. This is done via a sine function. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>We are very satisfied with the results of this generator. We were very stumped on the idea of creating a hypnotic effect, but we really wanted to try it. We got inspiration from a link in #share-your-art in the class discord to based the effect off of that. This generator satisfies all the requirements of this assignment and this is the generator we definitely had the most fun with.
